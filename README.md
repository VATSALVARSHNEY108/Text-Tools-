# Text Processing Tools Application
## Overview
A comprehensive Streamlit-based web application that provides a collection of text processing utilities organized into 10 distinct categories. The application offers tools for text conversion, formatting, analysis, encoding, generation, and various other text manipulation tasks. Built as a single-page application with category-based navigation and integrated QR code generation capabilities.

##User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
